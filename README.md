Artificial Intelligence can be used in marketing to forecast which products 
should be sold in which countries. 
This can be accomplished using the K-means clustering algorithm, Auto-Encoders, and Principal Component Analysis.
All of the 2D and 3D graphs are included in the ipynb file's code. We delete the columns that will not be used in the computation, and then use K-means and auto-encoders to determine the optimum number of clusters.
